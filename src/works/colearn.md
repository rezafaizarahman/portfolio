### Context

Colearn is an EdTech company that uses AI to aid students in comprehending math problems.

Colearn began operations by partnering with an offline tuition center to enhance Indonesia's education. However, the offline tuition model has many drawbacks, such as cost and time, making it accessible only to certain students. Moreover, due to COVID-19, offline activities have become inefficient and risky.

As a Product Designer, I help CoLearn transform its business from a tuition center platform to an automated, scalable, and effective learning tool in Indonesia.

I designed an AI-powered "automated doubt-solving" and interactive class learning feature to help students study during the COVID-19 pandemic. Today, CoLearn is one of Indonesia's fastest-growing education technology companies, with over 2.5 million users. In 2020, Google Play selected CoLearn as the best app in the personal growth category.

### Think

One of the challenges to transform the business is we only have a limited time. I collaborate with the Customer Insight team to validate the early-stage changes to save time.

We conducted 1:1 online interviews with students from various Indonesian cities to gain insights into their learning experiences. Three main points emerged from the interviews:

<div style="background-color:#EFF1F6; border-radius:16px" class="relative px-10 py-10 bg-blue-50">

        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
</div>

### Explore

We explored the problem by creating a customer journey. We defined the student's interaction with CoLearn.

</div>

<div class="col-start-2 col-end-10">
{% figure 'colearn-users-journey-map-practice-platform', 'User Journey Map for Practice Platform feature', 'User Journey Map for Practice Platform feature' %}
</div>

<div class="col-start-3 col-end-9">

From the customer journey, we convert to a main flow and create a wireframe to confirm the idea. In this stage, we decide to include four main features:

<div style="background-color:#1e40af; border-radius:16px" class="relative px-10 py-10 bg-blue-50">
  <div class="text-base leading-6 space-y-4 text-white sm:text-lg sm:leading-7">

        </li>
        <li class="flex flex-col items-start">
          <div class="ml-2 text-lg font-bold">Bimbel (Tuition Center)</div>
          <p class="ml-2 text-lg">Students can locate nearby tuition centers and enroll for long-term learning. This will provide a deeper understanding rather than merely studying when they encounter difficulties.</p>

        <li class="flex flex-col items-start">
          <div class="ml-2 text-lg font-bold">Practice</div>

        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="col-start-2 col-end-10">
{% figure 'colearn-main-flow', 'CoLearn Main FLow', 'Main Flow - CoLearn 2.0' %}
</div>

<div class="col-start-3 col-end-9">

### Build

#### Wireframe

We create the wireframe based on the main flow we constructed earlier. We aim to confirm our hypothesis: Will the student problems be solved by these features?

</div>

<div class="col-start-2 col-end-10">
{% figure 'wireframe-1', 'Screenshot CoLearn Wireframe', '' %}
</div>

<div class="col-start-3 col-end-9">

</div>

<div class="col-start-2 col-end-10">
{% figure 'wireframe-2', 'Screenshot CoLearn Wireframe', '' %}
</div>

<div class="col-start-3 col-end-9">

</div>

<div class="col-start-2 col-end-10">
{% figure 'wireframe-3', 'Screenshot CoLearn Wireframe', '' %}
</div>

<div class="col-start-3 col-end-9">

We began by researching with students to test our wireframe. We hypothesized that students would no longer visit the tuition center. So, we conducted A/B testing by creating two versions of the prototype; one with the Bimbel (Tuition Center) feature, and one without it.

The research results surprised us. Some of the features we had previously investigated failed to meet student needs. Here is our insight:

<div style="background-color:#EFF1F6; border-radius:16px" class="relative px-10 py-10 bg-blue-50">
  <div class="text-base leading-6 space-y-4 text-gray-700 sm:text-lg sm:leading-7">

      </ul>

<br>

Based on our insights, we are considering merging and modifying some features. We have identified three main components:

### High-fidelity

#### Live Class

**Learn concepts, practice together, and prepare for exams in an interactive, live class.**

Live classes help students build confidence in understanding concepts. Teachers teach and interact with students in real-time, making it easier for students to comprehend the material, practice questions, and prepare for exams.

</div>

<div class="col-start-3 col-end-9">

#### Ask (automated doubt solving)

**Get step-by-step video solutions to your math problems instantly.**

The Ask feature is designed to help students learn from their mistakes, enabling them to gain a deeper understanding of concepts quickly.

Students can take a photo of any question they don't understand. CoLearn uses image recognition and natural language processing technology to automatically provide video solutions.

<div class="col-start-3 col-end-9">

#### Practice

**Prepare for exams by practicing answering questions from different subjects.**

The Practice feature helps students hone their skills in answering questions from different subjects so they can gain a better understanding.

Students can exercise themselves by taking simulated exams like the real thing. Upon completion, they receive an immediate report to identify areas for improvement.

#### WhatsApp Chatbot

**Grow user base by leveraging the most popular channels.**

More than 80% of internet users in Indonesia use WhatsApp. To increase user growth, we've been exploring alternative channels rather than relying solely on social media promotion.

We collaborate with the UX Writer to design the WhatsApp chatbot feature. We use Botsociety for prototyping, making it easy to test and share with stakeholders.

#### Design System

**Creating a cohesive and scalable design system**

We developed a design system to ensure consistency and accelerate the design and development process. Our goal was to create a design system that is straightforward, understandable and visually appealing for students.

We define a foundation of colors, typography, elevation, icons, and grids to make it easier to use across Web, iOS, and Android platforms. This enables the team to build a faster and more accessible interface.

{% figure 'token-2', 'Screenshot CoLearn Design Token', '' %}
</div>

<div class="col-start-3 col-end-9">

In addition to Foundation, we construct Core UI components such as Avatar, Tag, Button, Form and Alert. As the app expands, we also develop new components as templates, such as Top Bar, Bottom Bar and Feedback.

By creating the design system, we want to make it easier for everyone. Starting from designers themselves, engineers, and users.
