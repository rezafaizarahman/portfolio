Bukalapak is one of the largest C2C e-commerce in Southeast Asia. As a designer in the Core Design team, I was responsible for constructing and maintaining a design system, initiated a design toolkit and collaborated with designers to accomplish workflow problems to be effective.

- Worked with 20+ people from different disciplines to define, build and launch design systems to make the product experience more cohesive & scalable. The first release of the design system was launched in only 6 months.

- Built a set of comprehensive UI kits consisting of Android, iOS, and Web Desktop to save designer time significantly so they can focus on finding a solution to a design problem.

- Designed components for the design system based on WCAG accessibility standards and compliance requirements, in order to make the design are usable by a wide range of people, regardless of age, size or disability status.
