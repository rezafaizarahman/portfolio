Bukalapak is an online marketplace to enable small and medium enterprises go online and has expanded to support smaller traditional family owned businesses (warungs).

As a designer in the Merchant team, I worked with researchers, engineers, data scientists, and PMs to build seller-facing products.

- Designed and conceptualized Seller Center, a dashboard used by brands and merchants to market and sell their products directly to Bukalapak’s customers. Focusing on seller transactions that cover the journey from processing orders to courier receipt. Increased 15% of sellers’ speed in managing transactions.

- Work with the technology team to build a new feature for sellers called "Ubah status sekaligus" (change bulk status) to increase processing time from one by one to 90 transactions at a time.

- Designed a Preorder feature to help sellers generate buzz and build momentum before launch, gauge the market demand the product and lockdown early sales to fund production.

- Collaborate with UX Researchers to get insights from users by conducting research sessions.

- Doing the design process from translating research insights into actionable product ideas, facilitating ideations with all team members, collaborate with PMs to create product requirements, translating insight & product ideas into user flows & journeys, creating lo-fi to hi-fi design & interactive prototypes until design spec to handoff for developers.
